## Avoiding JVM Delays Caused by Random Number Generation

The library used for random number generation in Sun's JVM relies on /dev/random by default for UNIX platforms.
This can potentially block the Server process because on some operating systems /dev/random waits for a certain amount
of "noise" to be generated on the host machine before returning a result.

That's why this image includes that setting by default allowing the use of urandom instead of random
